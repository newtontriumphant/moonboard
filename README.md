# moonboard, by zsharpminor :3

Hi fellow reviewers! This is Moonboard - an RP2040-powered devboard with an integrated temperature sensor, status LED, and switch. This is a **tickets-only project**, but I'm still taking it seriously nevertheless.

## Credits:

Tutorial I followed:

https://github.com/KaiPereira/build-a-devboard/

I also got some help from another friend who had previously made a devboard, he helped me with positioning and routing the components.

## Detailed Description and Reason For Making:

Besides wanting some tickets, I made this project to get experience wiring tight spaces in KiCad - my first time wiring a non-premade MCU. The tutorial was quite helpful, and in the few places where it stumped me, Google and my friend were able to help! I think that designing this devboard was a really educational process, and I feel ready for Prototype! Images are attached below. Now - this is my first devboard - I probably made some obvious errors - I had my friend review it and he said it looked good, I fixed all DRC errors, fellow reviewers please do let me know what I can fix/improve on - but keep in mind this project won't be shipped anytime soon, it was mainly to practice my KiCad skills for Prototype!
